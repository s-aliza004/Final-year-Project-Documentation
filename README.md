# Final-Year-Project-Documentation

The project aims to develop an automated attendance system for classrooms using camera equipped with facial recognition technology. Traditional attendance tracking methods often suffer from inefficiencies, such as manual recording errors and time-consuming processes. By leveraging cameras and advanced facial recognition algorithms, this system offers a more accurate, efficient, and convenient way to monitor student attendance in educational settings. The system logs attendance in real-time, provides notifications of anomalies.

In today's fast-paced educational environment, efficient management of classroom attendance poses a significant challenge for educators and administrators alike. Traditional methods of attendance taking, such as manual roll calls or paper-based sign-in sheets, are time-consuming, prone to errors, and often lack real-time insights into student attendance patterns. To address these challenges and streamline the attendance tracking process, we propose the "Smart Automated Classroom Attendance System."
